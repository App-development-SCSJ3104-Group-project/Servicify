using an action steps
 1- import{action name} from action directory
 2- const {action name }=this.props, destructing the action from props 
 note actions are treated similary to state props IT NEEDS TO BE PASSED USING PROPS
 3-Add the imported action into the mapdispatchto props function
 NOTE Action needs to be called inside a callback, it can not be called directly 
 on a click function for example onclick={action.name()} is nto gonna work 
 but onclick={()=>action.name()} is the way it works
