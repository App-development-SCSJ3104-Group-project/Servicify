 redux connection notes
connect(1stargument, 2ndarugment)(componentName)
1st argument is not optional which is mapstatetoprops
2nd argument is optional which is map dispatch to props
incase you dont have mapdispatch to props you can directly use connect(mapStateToProps)(componentName)
but if youu dont have mapStateToProps and have mapDispatchToProps you need to set the first argument to be null so it will be connect(null,mapDispatchToProps)(componentNAME)


userReducer is the name of the reducer that we want access its inner state
    you need to specify the reducer in order to acess its inner state
  mapstate to props notes
    const mapStateToProps=({reducerName eg:userReducer})=>({
   statePropertyNameThatIsUsedByComponent:statePropertyNameThatIsUsedAtReducer,
    note its better to name both side similary so confusin is avoided
 });


using an action steps
 1- import{action name} from action directory
 2- const {action name }=this.props, destructing the action from props 
 note actions are treated similary to state props IT NEEDS TO BE PASSED USING PROPS
 3-Add the imported action into the mapdispatchto props function
 NOTE Action needs to be called inside a callback, it can not be called directly 
 on a click function for example onclick={action.name()} is nto gonna work 
 but onclick={()=>action.name()} is the way it works
